Abstract
<br>After analyzing three different metrics, we have come to the conclusion that North Shore is the best neighborhood. We measured the overall conditions of trees in each neighborhood, the wealth and education in each neighborhood, and finally the percent of poor housing conditions in each neighborhood. We believe each metric would give us a good idea about the best neighborhood as they took in both an environmental and socioeconomic aspect of the neighborhoods, which are both equally important when considering the best neighborhood. After discussing different approaches, our group determined that the best combined metric would be to rank neighborhoods based on their combined environmental and socioeconomic metrics, and eliminate neighborhoods with a positive poor housing score. Although each metric produced its own set of best neighborhoods, by combining the metrics we have concluded that the best neighborhood is North Shore, which places 4th for wealth and education, 6th for tree conditions, and scores a 0 on the percent poor housing index.

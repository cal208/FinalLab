Abstract
<br>After analyzing three different metrics, we have come to the conclusion that ___ is the best neighborhood. We measured the overall conditions of trees in each neighborhood, the wealth and education in each neighborhood, and finally the percent of poor housing conditions in each neighborhood. We believe each metric would give us a good idea about the best neighborhood as they took in both an environmental and socioeconomic aspect of the neighborhoods, which are both equally important when considering the best neighborhood. Although each metric produced its own set of best neighborhoods, by combining the metrics and weighing some differently, we can decided that the best neighborhood is __ .
